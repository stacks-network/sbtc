All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can

there are no panics due to indexes out of bounds (as rustc would catch an
out-of-bounds literal index). I did not check whether arithmetic overflows
could cause a panic, and I am relying on the Coq code having satisfied the
