//! # Signer storage
//!
//! This module contains the `Read` and `Write` traits representing
//! the interface between the signer and their internal database.
//!
//! The canonical implementation of these traits is the [`postgres::PgStore`]
//! allowing the signer to use a Postgres database to store data.
