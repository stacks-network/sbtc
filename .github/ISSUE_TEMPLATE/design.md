# Design - [ASPECT_IN_QUESTION]

This ticket holds the design of [ASPECT_IN_QUESTION] and how it fits into [PROJECT_IN_QUESTION].

<!-- You are creating this discussion to ultimately finalize an engineering approach.

Design discussions are a vehicle for engineering conversations; they are an auditable artifact that
tracks a decision and how it was made, and formalizes a path to cementing a final design. These
discussions allow us to inspect our decision making process and later verify that the decisions we
made used the latest information and prevent design changes from occurring during implementation that
aren’t beneficial to the previously considered constraints. -->
