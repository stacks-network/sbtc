//! This module contains functionality for creating stacks transactions for
//! sBTC contract calls.
//!
//! Contains structs for the following contract calls:
//! * [`CompleteDepositV1`]: Used for calling the complete-deposit-wrapper
//!   function in the sbtc-deposit contract. This finalizes the deposit by
//!   minting sBTC and sending it to the depositor.
//! * [`AcceptWithdrawalV1`]: Used for calling the
//!   accept-withdrawal-request function in the sbtc-withdrawal contract.
//!   This finalizes the withdrawal request by burning the locked sBTC.
//! * [`RejectWithdrawalV1`]: Used for calling the
//!   reject-withdrawal-request function in the sbtc-withdrawal contract.
//!   This finalizes the withdrawal request by returning the locked sBTC to
//!   the requester.
//! * [`RotateKeysV1`]: Used for calling the rotate-keys-wrapper function
//!   in the sbtc-bootstrap-signers contract. This changes the valid caller
//!   of most sBTC related functions to a new multi-sig wallet.
