# Emily Integration Tests

This directory runs Emily integration tests using the client created
by the autogenerated openapi template. It's contained in a separate
crate from the original Emily API in order to avoid a circular
dependency on the crate that's used to generate the openapi spec in
the first place.

## Configuration

The configuration file for the tests can be found in
`./emily/client-tests/tests/integration/config/default.toml`. The following
is an example config:

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 3031
```

This example matches the default command line arguments for the `emily-server`
binary in the `handler` crate.
